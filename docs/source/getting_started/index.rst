Introduction
------------

temo is a library for optimizing thermodynamic models powered by the teqp library. The library teqp calculates equation of state derivatives by algorithmic dervatives, which allows it to be very flexible. Combining these tools together allows for a very robust and powerful approach for fitting mixture models in very generic fashion.
